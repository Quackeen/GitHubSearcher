# GitHub Search Challenge

### Sample iPhone app that allows the user to search throughout GitHub and display users found along with their information.

Can search amongst a user's repos, as they type, and view their repo on the web.

#### Note: 

The project currently does not avoid GitHub's rate limit of service calls, which causes the program to not be able to function appropriately (will show blank results). 

If there are no results showing, please wait an hour and try again.
